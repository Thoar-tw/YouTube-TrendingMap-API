By using the YouTube API and Mapbox frontend interactive map, the *YouTube Trending Map* enables users to *get* the **Hot videos list** based on **categories** and **countries**. Moreover, users can *get* the **Top videos** (default is Top 10) from a single country to the whole world. Therefore, Users can have a deeper glimpse at YouTube trending videos around the world with the *YouTube Trending Map*.
